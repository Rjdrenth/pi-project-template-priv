ðŸš€ Feature Request

Tests coverage reporting.
ðŸ”ˆ Motivation

I found it in your ToDos. I implemented it for my own package pycvcqv using coverage-badge.
ðŸ›° Alternatives

To implement such a solution:

    first, edit your pyproject.toml:

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]

coverage = "*"

coverage-badge = "*"

pytest-html = "*"

pytest-cov = "*"



[tool.coverage.run]

source = ['package_name', 'tests_folder']



[coverage.paths]



source = 'package_name'



[coverage.run]

branch = true



[coverage.report]

fail_under = 50

show_missing = true

    next, mkdir assets/images/.
    Then, add these lines to Makefile:

.PHONY: coverage

coverage:

	poetry run pytest --cov-report html --cov packagename tests/

	poetry run coverage-badge -o assets/images/coverage.svg -f

    Then, run these lines:

make install

make test && make coverage && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety

    Finally, add this to the README.md:

[![coverage report](assets/images/coverage.svg)]

You, will have something like coverage report.
ðŸ“Ž Additional context

More importantly, you can open htmlcov/index.html in your browser and observe the covered/uncovered codes.
